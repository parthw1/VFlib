1. What is "ctext2pgm" ?

Ctext2pgm makes a bitmap of a text encoded in compound text.
Bitmap format is PGM, PBM, EPS and ASCII art format.   
Not only it accepts compound text encodings but also it
accepts EUC-Japanese, EUC-Korean, and EUC-Chinese encodings 
for input file encodings.

This program supports scripts of Left-to-Right writing direction.
Therefore, Arabic and Hebrew languages are not supported.
Currently, the following character sets are supported:

     ASCII                  (English), 
     ISO 8859-1,2,3,4,9     (English, German, Italy, French, Spanish, etc)
     ISO 8859-5             (Russian)
     ISO 8859-7             (Greek)
     ISO 8859-8             (Hebrew)
     Mule Arabic            (Arabic by Mule editor)
     JIS X 0201             (Japanese Roman and and Roman)
     JIS X 0208             (Japanese Kanji)
     GB 2312                (Chinese Hanzi)
     CNS 11641              (Chinese Hanzi)
     KSC 5601               (Hangle)


2. Installing ctext2pgm
     
To compile the program, run the "configure" script and then, run "make" 
in ctext2pgm directory:

     % ./configure [RET]
     % make [RET]

To install the program, become the root user and run "make" with an 
"install" argument:

     # make install [RET]

The program "ctext2pgm" and default vflibcap file (a font database) 
"vflibcap-ctext2pgm" is installed. The program used "vflibcap-ctext2pgm"
for its font database file by default.


3. Running ctext2pgm

Run ctext2pgm with a `-help' option. Short help message is printed.
See `VFlib-34.info' (users manual of VFlib 3.4) for detail.


4. Fonts

Ctext2pgm used VFlib library to obtain glyphs of characters of various
character sets.  A file `vflibcap-ctext2pgm' defines a set of fonts
that are used in ctext2pgm.  Standard `vflibcap-ctext2pgm' defines
fonts to use standard fonts of X Window system in PCF format.
(ISO8859-{2,3,4,9}, Mule Arabic, and CNS11641 fonts are not included 
standard X WIndow system.)

You can obtain these optional fonts from the following URLs.
   ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/fonts/ETL/
   ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/fonts/japanese/
   ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/fonts/chinese/
If optional fonts are installed under directories 
   /usr/local/share/fonts/X11/ETL/
   /usr/local/share/fonts/X11/japanese/
   /usr/local/share/fonts/X11/chinese/
in your system, respectively, you can use the default vflibcap file
without any modifications. Since the fonts are in BDF format, 
a shell script shown below may be useful to convert from BDF 
to PCF:

 - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -
#! /bin/sh
for BDF in `echo *.bdf.gz` 
do
  echo ${BDF}...
  PCF=`echo ${BDF} | sed 's/.bdf.gz$/.pcf/'`
  rm -f ${PCF} ${PCF}.gz
  gzip -cd < ${BDF} | bdftopcf | gzip -c > ${PCF}.gz
done
 - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -  - * -

If you want to use these optional fonts by application software 
on X Window system (e.g., multilingual editor Mule), the "fonts.dir"
file is necessary in the directory.

Run the "mkfontdir" program to make `fonts.dir' file.
This file is necessary if you want to use such font on application 
software on X Window.


5. Making multilingual text files

Use the Mule editor. It is distributed from the following URL:
   ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/
