This directory contains the following files that are related to
Japanese TeX localized by ASCII Coop.

   *.adj  ---  Font metric adjustment files for using font files
               whose font metrics are different from Japanese fonts
               used by Japanese TeX.


If you want to use many Japanese fonts, see what will happen 
if you run the following command sequence:

  % su   (be a root user)
  # make install-jfm

It copies min10.tfm to another so that we can use new TFM (JFM) files
for Japanese fonts. A file 'flist-ja.txt' is a font list to install.
You can modify it for your system. After you modify it, run

  % make update

to update some files created from 'def.txt'. 
Then, run "make install-jfm" again.
