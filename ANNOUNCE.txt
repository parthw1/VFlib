* NOTE: The source code of VFlib 3.7.2 is identical to VFlib 3.7.1,
   however, it comes now with two licenses:
     - GPLv3 
     - FreeType Project License (FTL)
   Choose the one which fits your needs best.


VFlib is a font library written in C language with several functions
to obtain bitmaps of fonts.  Unique feature of VFlib is that fonts
in different formats are accessed by unified interface.

VFlib supports the following font formats:
   TeX fonts:       PK, GF, VF, TFM
   Omega TeX fonts: OFM (level 0), OVF
   X Window fonts:  PCF, BDF
   Other fonts:     TrueType, Type 1, HBF, Syotai Club, JG, ekanji

   * The FreeType library version 1.2 is used for 
     TrueType format support. Install it before you install VFlib.
   * The T1Lib library version 5.1 is used for Type 1
     format support. Install it before you install VFlib.
   * Kpathsae  library 3.2 (in web2c-7.2) is used for 
     font file search. Install it before you install VFlib.
   * Syotai Club and JG are font formats for Japanese Kanji characters.

VFlib version 3 supports fonts for various languages. (VFlib versions 
1 and 2 supports only Japanese Kanji fonts.)

I also developed the TeX-Guy package, which is a set of previewers
and printer drivers for TeX DVI files using VFlib.

At this moment, only Unix-like operating systems are supported.
VFlib is tested on FreeBSD 5.3.
You must write makefiles by yourself to compile 
VFlib on Windows {3.1, 95, 98, NT}, for example. (Since GNU 
autoconf and GNU libtool are used to compile programs in VFlib, 
porting may not simple. I'm not sure.) But the source code itself 
contain less Unix-specific parts.  Please let me know if you 
successfully ported VFlib to non-Unix systems.
